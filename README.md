<b><u>Note: </u></b> This project is currently a work in progress and I'll be adding to the README as I go along.  Stay tuned!
  
Spotify has emerged as the largest and most popular platform for streaming music in the world.  With millions of songs available as well as millions of users streaming them, Spotify is able to amass a huge amount of relevant music data and is generous enough to share this data through their Spotfy for Developers program.  With background as both a musician and a music industry professional, there is a giant curiosity about whether we can use machine learning to answer questions that have long eluded the entier industry, especially "What makes a hit?"

This project is a work in progress at the moment, but the goal is to analyze a large dataset of Spotify song data with the intention of answering the following questions:
- Using all possible data, what features make a song a 'hit'?
- Using strictly audio data, what features make a song a 'hit'?
- Can we create a model that can accurately predict whether a new song will be a 'hit'?
